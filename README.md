The Repository Pattern in C# is a design pattern that provides an abstraction layer between the application's business logic and the data access logic. It separates the code that interacts with the data storage (e.g., database, file system) from the rest of the application. The pattern is commonly implemented using interfaces and concrete classes, where the interfaces define the contract for data operations (such as Create, Read, Update, Delete), and the concrete classes implement the actual data access logic. By using the Repository Pattern, the application achieves a more modular and maintainable architecture, allowing for easier testing, decoupling, and flexibility in switching or modifying the data storage implementation.
